Meant as as resource for those who are interested in learning a Lisp dialect through the book "[Land of Lisp](http://landoflisp.com]" by Conrad Barski, but who want to use [Racket](http://racket-lang.org) instead.

The file 'equivalent.txt' lists operators and functions from the book and their equivalents in Racket.

The code written in Racket is organized into folders by chapter.

Now go and have fun learning to program in Racket, one game at a time.
